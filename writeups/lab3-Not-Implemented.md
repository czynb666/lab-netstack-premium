### Not Implemented

- Poorly designed tests, poorly designed test-running
- Poorly designed multi-threading
- Poorly designed error catching system
- The TCP stack can only support one connection on a host.
- `getaddrinfo()` is not implemented.
- There might be some corner cases in which multiple specific command packets are dropped, and the program breaks.
- Low throughput due to long waiting.
